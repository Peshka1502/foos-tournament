# Foosball tournament organizer

This is a web interface and a set of command line tools to help organize a foosball
tournament. We currently use it at [Tuenti](http://www.tuenti.com/) to handle a
tournament for about 60 people.

It relates to the [Foosball instant replay](https://github.com/swehner/foos) project.

Barely working version, expect documentation and a demo soon.
